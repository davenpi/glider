## Gliding by changing shape

This code forms the core of a project where I want to see how shape change affect gliding characteristics.
We are building on the work of Paoletti and Mahadevan. The equations describing the glider are given in their
paper "Controlled Gliding and Tumbling." Instead of controlling the pitch angle as they did I want to control 
the aspect ratio of the ellipse. The point being that changing the aspect ratio changes the aerodynamic propertiesof the object.
